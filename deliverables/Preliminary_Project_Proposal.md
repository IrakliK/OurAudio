# 2.0 Preliminary Project Proposal

My purposed project idea was to create a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) synthesizer. The synthesizer would include two oscillators with different types of sound-waves. In addition, the synthesizer would include filter types which allows the user to get creative with all different EQ filter types. A built in suite of effects would have been available for users to tweak their sound.
