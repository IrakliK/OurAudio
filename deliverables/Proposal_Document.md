# 3.0 Project Proposal Document

## Verbal Description

OurAudio is a music platform for musicians to share, promote and get feedback on their song. This platform is intended for those who are either new to the music industry or need help to get their sound promoted. OurAudio would not only help out the musicians but however it will help the public/listeners to find their new favorite artist. This web application would be available to users who sign up and create an account with OurAudio. Each user will have a profile page which holds all of their submitted songs and songs awaiting for feedback. Also, the profile page would have a feed of all the promoted tracks that the musician has requested OurAudio to promote. Users will only be able to receive feedback on their songs if and only if they gave feedback on a different users song.


## Justification

Data Structures and Algorithms are the two main studies that would apply to OurAudio. While developing OurAudio the notion of efficiency and logic are going to make it easy for me to tackle down problems quickly. I am expecting to gain more knowledge of Databases and how to use them efficiently. Since OurAudio is going to hold important information, it is important to choose a strong Database that efficiently and securely access the data. With 11 weeks left to work on this project, it is a reasonable amount of time to have at least two of the intended features to be developed. This project motivates me because I myself am an artist that produces electronic music. I started off small and it was very difficult for me to enter the music industry with no knowledge of music production. With OurAudio, musicians are exposed.
